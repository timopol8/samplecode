In the graph we can see that as the array size is increased the time increases more and more drastically.
The type of sorting I used is called Bubble sort. Time complexity of my code can be expressed as a function O(n^2). 
The sorting was slow and has time complexity O(n^2), and finding modes was fast with time complexity O(n).
On this graph of array size vs time it is not possible to see which parts of the code take longer or shorter time.
